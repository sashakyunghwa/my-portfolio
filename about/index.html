                      <p>Okay, enough of the Beyonce puns for the day. On the real though... I'm Sasha Kyung-Hwa Ross. I'm a H.A.P.A. girl from the streets of Orange County, California. I take pride in my authentic self of being able to identiy and intertwine with both backgrounds and cultures of my Korean and American side.</p>
                      <p>In the midst of being confused with my identity and wanting to get in touch with my Korean roots, I decided to do some "Seoul Searching" while teaching English in Seoul, South Korea for a couple years. This gave me an amazing opportunity to meet relatives I had never met before, embrace the Korean culture- everything from fashion, food, k-drama and k-pop, and understand my Korean idenitty. While abroad, I would occasionaly get the homesick Western food cravings, so I decided to start a blog to document good Western food spots and help others expats that were looking for good Western food spots as well. My blog name was "Basic Bitch Seoulvivor", since many times I felt like I was such a "basic" SoCal girl surviving in this foreign country. I'd get those Pumpkin Spice Lattes, In-N-Out, Chipotle cravings from time to time, so I wanted to be able to find good, yet affordable Western food spots that would hit those cravings.</p>
                      <p>The concept of my "Basic Bitch Seoulvivor" blog is how I came up with the idea of interwining the American and Korean flag, representing my experience in Korea and my identity as a person. My blog inspired me to want to make my own website, which is how I came across becoming a Web Designer & Developer.</p>
                      <p>So there you have it, I'm a Web Designer & Developer, and do some photography and blogging on the side as a hobby. I'm open to collaborations on creative projects and new opportunities for professional growth. Anything to get my creative juices flowing excites me, so...</p>
